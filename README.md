# Aghan‑Cities 🇦🇫

**Aghan‑Cities** is a structured dataset of cities and locations in Afghanistan.  
This project provides names, and optionally other details, of important Afghan cities, provinces, districts, and areas — which can be used for web apps, maps, learning, or programming projects.

## 🗺️ Project Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Provide a clear and organized list of **Afghan cities and locations**
- Help developers use this data in projects such as:
  - Websites
  - Geo‑location features
  - Dropdown lists for forms
  - Mapping and visualization tools

This is especially useful for students and developers working with **geographical datasets** or learning how to handle real world location data.
